* Migration: The workload is still present, but elsewhere. This covers cleanup after live migrate, cold migrate, and evacuate. We must not cleanup shared resources, only resources local to this hypervisor.

* Deletion: The workload is going away. Cleanup everything.

We have a bug that we're not cleaning up the instance directory for a migration cleanup if the backend is rbd.

Firstly we don't have a good way without a more invasive change of asserting that the operator doesn't have both rbd and nfs instance storage, hence the requirement for the workaround. The workaround is an assertion by the operator that they're not doing this, and this is safe.

is_shared_block_storage isn't set when called during evacuate cleanup, and destroy_disks is wrong in general because ComputeManager attempts to second guess the hypervisor, so ignoring these 2 values is correct.

The assertion therefore is:

* backend is rbd
* operator asserts that they aren't using shared instance storage
* it's a migration cleanup

Note that we must assert that it's a migration cleanup, because we also call cleanup(destroy_disks=False) from hard reboot, and we don't want to delete the instance directory in that case.

This looks correct to me, and a backportable workaround.

It's obviously a hack, though, and I'd like to see it replaced with a better fix. I think the way forward here is to pass the migration/deletion intent to cleanup and have the virt driver decide what needs to be cleaned up, rather than second guessing in ComputeManager.",60,12/5/18 17:04,I8fd6b9f857a1c4919c3365951e2652d2d477df77,618478,9555,Matthew Booth,10135,Organization of code,REFACTOR,406,409,82,2792,6,45,3,3,1,0,9041,292,2450,40,0.0257288,9048,1366,1405,0.0163265,0.150973,0.0322973,2719,4064,200,273,3.68,2,21,d6c1f6a1032ed2ea99f3d8b70ccf38065163d785,0.0735565,0.0671752,0.0322973,0.00543561,3.74,3.62,259,293,43.66

Then if that rocky cell comes online, we would be sending stein RPC versions to rocky computes which would fail. Maybe that's really out of scope and as an operator you shouldn't enable that cell while the computes are backlevel, but the enable/disable cell stuff doesn't really have anything to do with whether or not you can send RPC messages to it.

1) if the provider tree cache of the resource provider with uuid exists already and if its fresh enough to not need refresh, then we go into the cache of the rest of the descendant nodes under this tree and directly add those node uuids whose cache is stale and needs refreshing (which would never be stake if association_refresh config is disabled). so that way we do not need to query placement to get the ""in_tree?"" nodes, since we pick it up from the cache of the provided uuid.

2) only if either the tree doesn't exist (which would only be during startup and/or sighup) or if its cache is stale which wouldn't happen if the association_refresh config is disabled, would it do the ""in_tree?"" query to placement.",14,11/22/18 10:49,Ieeaad9783e0ff93377fbc6c7932618d2fac8946a,615677,26936,Surya Seetharaman,14070,Question,DISCUSS,65,70,8,1072157,8,261,6,6,0,0,2415,4,210,1,0.00789889,2415,431,203,0.0047619,0.178468,0.00165631,282,300,3,3,3.985,2,20,deef31729bd54f3747b7adba4132f148559c2242,0.0106383,0.01,0.00156006,0.000150365,3.89,4.08,220,167,59.84

we should default to True on the sable branches.

the reasoning behind this is reletivly simply.

1.) this would be a behavior change to backprot with the default of false as live migration however broken would no longer ""work"" following a minor update.

2.) ovs-dpdk, vpp, snabb, and vrouter all support vhost-user which requires hugepages to be used as nova cannot configure a non hugepage memory backing currently that meets there needs. one of the key factors in calculating the appropriateness of any of these vhost user backends over sriov is the fact they allow live migration. defaulting to False would retroactively change that calculation. if yo remove livemigraton from equation the only motivating reasons for not using sriov are security groups and vxlan/tunneling support.

note that vhost-user backends are most common in NFV deployments where hardware tends to be uniform. additionally
when huge pages are used without CPU pinning the failure rate
for live migration is much lower and in production is typically not an issue.

3.) this can cause issue when people use cpu pinning or have
non uniform hosts so this is valuable to backport for deployment that are not using vhost-user backends. as such i am not arguing we should not backport the feature but just the default on stable is wrong.",56,12/18/18 14:20,I217fba9138132b107e9d62895d699d238392e761,625880,11604,sean mooney,15334,Logical,FUNCTION,31,160,36,11247,1,192,12,9,1,0,230,0,16,0,0,258,14,1,0,0.0542636,0,30,1060,2,14,4.11,2,1,52b89734426253f64b6d4797ba4d849c3020fb52,0.0666667,0.0132075,0,0.00645161,3.71,4.51,199,230,25.69

Not necessarily here, but at some point, we may wish to pass the helper_exception as exc into ResourceProviderSyncFailed so when that top-level logging happens, we have some association. Or we may wish to do some logging here.

Failures during periodic jobs and the RPC handlers tend to be terribly hard to debug for people out there, so the more noise we can get into the logs the better.

That said, this particular situation isn't so much a failure as one of several expected ways in which things can temporarily go wrong that will be fixed later.

1) we clear this refresh_time cache for all nodes as well so that after the SIGHUP, the `refresh_time` would be zero (https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/7217e38bafb75e8a613763835b64e48e6b2c8ece/nova/scheduler/client/report.py#L858) and we would hence load the RPT cache like on startup, on the first periodic update.

2) we could also just do a force refresh here: https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/7217e38bafb75e8a613763835b64e48e6b2c8ece/nova/scheduler/client/report.py#L768 maybe but that code path doesn't do an explicit inventory refresh which is why it isn't very useful here and also because we clear the whole tree, probably makes sense to load the tree freshly and refresh everything.

3) need to check how the SIGHUP of ironic compute would look like for all the underlying rp's at the same time (since in rocky starting up doesn't bring the service up so probably same effect).",14,11/21/18 14:14,I65a7ee565ca5b3ec6c33a2fd9e39d461f7d90ed2,615646,26936,Surya Seetharaman,14070,Other,FALSE,65,69,7,998044,7,28,5,5,0,0,2410,4,209,1,0.00797448,2415,434,203,0.00478469,0.17971,0.00165975,281,299,2,2,0,0,9,bbc2fcb8fb20dde1b81597c319392afb5b2c53fe,0.00711744,0.00668896,0.00165975,0.0000757,0,0,106,156,60.45

https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/nova-specs/specs/stein/approved/handling-down-cell_new.html#proposed-change

If the tenant has instances in a down cell we should fail the server create unless policy passes, correct? I don't see the failure / error logic in this change.

I also wonder if we are only going to enforce that with the microversion. It seems wrong to make people opt into not cheating their quota limits. Probably something we need to discuss, but I'd think once we have the policy rule and support for handling down cells during the quota check, we should change the behavior, regardless of microversion, to fail server create/resize if the tenant has instances in a down cell and they don't pass the policy check. Yes it would be an upgrade impacting behavior change, but it's also a safety measure for multi-cell deployments.

Also, I think I now realize what you were trying to ask me in IRC about the policy / microversion question; sorry I didn't fully grasp what you were asking. I think we can probably ignore the microversion for the down-cell quota check since quota checks can fail at any time and this is really fixing a bug / adding a safety measure for multi-cell operations. I will ask the question during the cells v2 session at the summit:

https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/BER-cells-v2-updates

now, libvirt in case of macVtap sets the MAC on the VF netdev not the VF idx, this means an additional fix will be needed in neutron sriov agent (sriovnicswitch) as today the agent relies on the VF idx mac address to determine if a port was successfully binded.

Thinking about this more now, let's say we fetch the compute node from the db prior to calling this, call that version 1. Then while were processing the keys, something else updates it, call that version 2. Then we get to L211 and decide that we need to do the update of the ratio values, so we do, call that version 3. Now here on L213, we take our compute objects, which is version 1, and give it the updated_at from version 3. That doesn't make any sense to me.

So I would say you should either:

 1. Not change updated_at at all
 2. Do this fixup and save as the first thing in _from_db_compute, and then load all the fields from the one object you get back from the update.

Looking at other fields, volume_type is probably also something to reset. What about device_name and guest_format? I guess guest_format wouldn't be set for a root bdm since guest_format is only for swap and ephemeral BDMs. But device_name could be changed on a subsequent attach request (even though we ignore it).

The image_id and snapshot_id fields would also likely be irrelevant if you changed the root volume, so I don't know if we should reset those to None or not also.",69,12/18/18 16:54,I7cdb79003b89ac400b169272f77eafdf210b3d17,614672,6873,Matt Riedemann,15888,Question,DISCUSS,2094,6354,294,1326121,11,64,6,5,0,0,468,15,56,5,0.12218,487,87,81,0.0892857,0.178645,0.0320513,120,2133,48,856,3.985,2,18,9311aceadf385e3c2655cf44aae720b9b7282eac,0.4,0.401313,0.0320513,0.161983,3.89,4.08,79,132,61.67

We get close to this code during bfv here:

https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/ba163cd5fd3e6ea9a42f0b8082e8e096885f0c57/nova/compute/manager.py#L1682

but if the bdm has a device_name specified, we skip that one:

https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/ba163cd5fd3e6ea9a42f0b8082e8e096885f0c57/nova/compute/manager.py#L1670

furthermore, if the bdm doesn't have a device_name set, we'd call the driver:

https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/ba163cd5fd3e6ea9a42f0b8082e8e096885f0c57/nova/compute/manager.py#L1598

and the libvirt driver implements that method:

https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/ba163cd5fd3e6ea9a42f0b8082e8e096885f0c57/nova/virt/libvirt/driver.py#L8984

So you should definitely set the max to like 1 and then try to bfv with 2 bdms with devstack and libvirt and make sure I'm not missing something, but if you can do that and it doesn't fail, it's likely because _prep_block_device isn't hitting this code path during bfv so we're not enforcing the limit.",69,12/12/18 16:31,Ia9cc1c250483c31f44cdbba4f6342ac8d7fbe92b,616777,6873,Matt Riedemann,4690,Logical,FUNCTION,2108,6378,495,2889977,1,67,5,4,0,0,1203,7,231,3,0.0127258,1211,62,94,0.012987,0.0511974,0.00581879,325,5448,101,1616,4.11,2,13,bb0906f4f3199295e9f65bd4c8f6cab995f4ec42,0.310769,0.296623,0.0044586,0.0972345,3.71,4.51,44,173,34.26

its possibel that this is the frist time this agent has managed this ironic node and we do want to prime the cache with the instace netwrok info.",60,4/15/19 16:23,I47d1aba17cd2e9fff67846cc243c8fbd9ac21659,649345,11604,sean mooney,22948,Design discussion,DISCUSS,44,219,0,121760,4,13,2,2,0,0,8541,0,3535,0,0,8542,1120,953,0,0.131117,0,3161,5609,31,41,3.865,1,9,091aa3289694a27704e48931a579f50a3179b036,0.00980702,0.00730968,0,0.0000992,3.66,4.07,143,100,56.15

1. I think I noted in the original review that while all in-tree scheduler drivers are using placement now, there is the chance that out of tree scheduler drivers are not, which would mean the Selection.allocation_request is None. However, you can only get here if the check above passes meaning someone is using a request which requires placement, so they can't even make that type of request unless placement is involved, so it's probably safe to assume if we get this far, the scheduler is using placement.

2. The other thing is allocation_request is a PUT /allocations/{consumer_id} request and while PUT and GET have the same format, they could technically drift at some point which could break this code, but if that happens we have the Selection.allocation_request_version value to massage the data back to the format we need. I'm not sure if you want to leave a note about this little caveat or not.

The idea was to have a (project_id, user_id) index that would solve queries that used both project_id and user_id and a single user_id index for queries that only used user_id. There is already an index on (project_id) alone (https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/db/sqlalchemy/api_models.py#L134) therefore a (project_id, user_id) index would make the single (project_id) index redundant.

So, it's enough here to just add one multi-column (user_id, project_id) index.

That said, that index would not be able to satisfy queries such as ""get me the number of distinct users that have instances in each project"" because of the order of the columns in the index.

It kind of obscures the actual change here, especially since the bug is about nova-compute, but we don't change the import ordering visibly for cmd/* things.

The actual thing that is important is that this code runs super early, which could still happen if we just moved the monkey_patch utility here, decoupling it from utils.py which imports a bunch of other stuff before we get a chance to run the helper.

We could replicate that here, but we'd either (a) just define and then call it, or (b) make all the users of this have two #noqa lines, as they import something out of order, and then run a statement before the rest of their imports.

So, what is here is probably better as it's more obvious that this definitely has to run at import time and it's harder to make it not do that.",67,3/14/19 17:52,Id46e76666b553a10ec4654d4418a9884975b5b95,626952,4393,Dan Smith,10135,Organization of code,REFACTOR,1212,4157,68,3719578,3,79,4,3,1,1,98,0,0,0,0,50,31,3,0,0.62,0,0,3514,0,479,3.68,2,13,3c5e2b0e9fac985294a949852bb8c83d4ed77e04,0,0.136312,0,0,3.74,3.62,144,168,45.62

i would have assumed from the signiture of this function that since we are passing presuable the new flaovr as the instance_type paramater that invoking self._move_claim would have use that instead of the  instance.new_flavor so it non obvious that instance.new_flavor would need to be set.

so just a general question. i have wonderd why we have instance.flavor .old_flavor and .new_flavor in the past and lookin at the patch that intoduced them it was non obviobious to me. 
https://github.com/openstack/nova/commit/8b6a22e0e132d8dac6c280c1cd8aed2bbe980760

am i correct in my understanding that instance.flavor is the current flavor the instace is useing. instance.new_flavor is the target  falvor for a resize and instance.old_flavor is used to store the current flavor so that we can restore it if we revert the resize?",58,2/21/19 22:56,Ieb539c9a0cfbac743c579a1633234537a8e3e3ee,636411,11604,sean mooney,6873,Design discussion,DISCUSS,39,188,56,797954,1,37,2,2,0,0,1509,0,366,0,0,1518,244,184,0,0.160738,0,595,5543,7,33,3.865,1,1,20a46ece5701c9798a5e0df12c944237cb1ece3e,0.0117647,0.00595345,0,0.000157916,3.66,4.07,111,144,44.34

    def unshelve(self, context, instance):

And in the case of shelved (not offloaded) the port resource requests still apply to the host on which the instance 'lives'. That's potentially racy if the nova-compute service automatically offloads the server while we're doing this check (the _poll_shelved_instances periodic task), but that task should also be setting the task_state so the API would reject the unshelve while the periodic task is running (I'm sure we could still miss that window but it's always existed so nothing new to worry about here).",70,1/28/19 18:22,I5a956513f3485074023e027430cc52ee7a3f92e4,630725,6873,Matt Riedemann,9708,Question,FALSE,2190,6538,381,12678,4,103,3,3,0,0,89,3,8,0,0,103,13,17,0,0.126214,0.0337079,17,1641,4,546,0,0,4,0b92325fe14eda062c78de2c3423ca4834861152,0.235294,0.332724,0.0337079,0.0653595,0,0,67,129,63.7

from the restore function alone we pass the qfd as False and for the rest of the deletes its True. So we could just make use of that flag, might make the code cleaner.

im not sure this nameing scheme caters for that properly so this is likely

ideally this would not contain the agentname.

you could work around this by using the neturon config to list

This does, however, leak details about what is validated and in the case of resize you *could* pass the root_bdm and it shouldn't be a problem because the image doesn't change and therefore if you passed create/rebuild it should be OK for resize.

Maybe it's just me, but I feel the algorithm would be easier to follow if instead of doing the whole list(zip(itertools.product())) thing, you had a simple loop over the request groups (self.requested_resources) and determined the provider used for each request group within the loop.

In other words, do something like this:

 allocs = copy.deepcopy(placement_allocations)
 for rg in self.requested_resources:
     rp_uuid = self._find_provider_for_group(rg, allocs, provider_traits)
     if rp_uuid is None:
         raise ValueError(...)
     rg.provider_uuids = [rp_uuid]

And then implement _find_provider_for_group() to simply find the first resource provider that meets the request group's traits and resource constraints:

 def _find_provider_for_group(self, group, allocs, prov_traits):
     # NOTE that allocs is updated to have its resource
     # totals decremented if we find a provider having
     # matching resources...
     
     for rp_uuid, alloc_dict in allocs.items():
         # Check if the provider has all the traits this
         # request group required... skip otherwise
         if (not all(req_trait in prov_traits[rp_uuid]
                 for req_trait in group.required_traits)):
             continue

         rp_allocs = alloc_dict['resources']
         grp_resources = group.resources.items()
         # Check if provider has enough capacity for each
         # resource we're requesting in this group. If not,
         # skip it
         if not all(rp_allocs[rc] >= grp_resources[rc]
                    for rc in group.resources):

Moving the option to be under control of the guest might run afoul of some operator's desire right?

Like, maybe the operator uses the serial number for agent correlation, or debugging, or forensics after an issue. By putting it fully within the user's control, they have no way to prevent them from making it unique right?

IMHO, if we're going to allow the image property, we should only honor it if this config is set to auto (or another new option called ""user""). But I would prefer we just not add the new image property, default this to ""unique"" in new installations and leave it at that.

I can think of only one somewhat silly case where the user might want to ask for the host's serial to be used, but it's pretty edge-case-y.

Also, we will still continue to show the root volume when listing volumes attached to the instance right? I mean with a GET /servers/{server_id}/os-volume_attachments call:

https://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/compute/?expanded=list-volume-attachments-for-an-instance-detail#list-volume-attachments-for-an-instance

So I would expect the device_name to not change. You also can't change the disk_bus or device_type on attach so that wouldn't affect the device name either.

Technically we can try to get the user_id from the RequestSpec *and* the BuildRequest:

- RequestSpec.user_id
- BuildRequest.instance.user_id

Failing those, if cell_mapping is set, we can try to get the Instance record via the cell. But if the cell is down, then we're pretty much screwed, right? What would we do, raise InstanceMappingNotFound or something? Otherwise it could result in a 500 response when trying to do GET /servers/{server_id}, but maybe that's OK because it is a 500 kind of situation, but you probably can't get out of it until the cell is back up since the online data migration is going to rely on talking to the cell as well to get the Instance.user_id.",71,3/1/19 20:35,I0f523b2a2e09e1ece9e1911325e55cffd183a9d5,633350,6873,Matt Riedemann,4690,Design discussion,DISCUSS,2201,6570,532,160381,8,31,3,2,0,0,297,14,22,1,0.055336,303,46,41,0.0454545,0.151815,0.047138,29,2172,19,890,3.865,2,17,7475e850174e3255696fad3f462558421d05d2fa,0.655172,0.409761,0.0215517,0.436782,3.66,4.07,86,147,65.12

Or should the device name calculation be consistent with what we had before, with the addition of allowing more devices (the patch below this one in the series)?

The reason I ask about the device name changing for existing attached BDMs is because virtual device tags for volumes are linked via the device name, so I'm wondering if we could have a case where a user creates a server, attaches some volumes with tags, we upgrade, and then the user can't correlate the device tags to the bdms in the metadata API anymore.

The implication here, by having a 'self.rt' prefix is that somehow what's happening here is somehow relevant to this thing called a ResourceTracker. It isn't, really. It's simply that we're deleting some allocations.

This is maintaining that never really true illusion (at least not since we moved to one resource tracker) that there's some separation between the manager and the resource tracker.

I agree that we should have a self.rt (for things like instance_claim()

But I reckon it is cleaner to have a self.reportclient, not a self.rt.reportclient if there is never going to be a self.something_else.reportclient

Earlier in the stack, you deleted a TODO of mine, which was to move a call to reportclient to be a call to rt so that we're only interacting with one layer of the rt, not sometimes punching through to the reportclient. But the way we have ended up doing things is to make the reportclient the placementclient, and thus lots of thing need to talk to reportclient, thus punching through is normal to the point of mentioning the rt at all is redundant.

Therefore self.rt.reportclient feels like noise.",57,1/15/19 18:09,Ibb8c12fb2799bb5ceb9e3d72a2b86dbb4f14451e,620711,11564,Chris Dent,14070,Solution Approach,REFACTOR,326,1287,212,225147,13,345,9,6,0,0,8266,0,3469,0,0,8236,1052,923,0,0.127732,0,3072,5457,85,206,4,2,18,35ce77835bb271bad3c18eaf22146edac3a42ea0,0.0276693,0.0377497,0,0.000774343,3.88,4.12,63,211,51.48

Now that I'm thinking about evacuate (move operations), I don't see anything in here that enforces this for migrate operations so I could create a server with let's say 25 volumes on host A, and then be migrated to host B which is configured with max=10, and it would work even though my server is violating that constraint. Granted, if you're going to set this ever, you're probably going to do it universally, or at least on hosts with similar hardware and grouped into aggregates or something similar, so it's less of a concern.

This is tightly coupled to the ironicclient implementation, specifically [1]. The **kwargs to the get_client method is documented only as ""all the other params that are passed to keystoneauth"" [2]. This is vague and not completely true at least in terms of Adapter kwargs. It's also not a prescriptive/proscriptive interface, so ironicclient can change up the internals as it sees fit - as we saw very recently right next door with the addition of interface handling [3].

Basically, it sucks how the ksa pieces of this puzzle are put together. It's brittle and will keep breaking in ways similar to this one, and we should fix it.
